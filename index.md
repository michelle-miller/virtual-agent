{{site.data.keyword.watson}}&trade; {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} provides the following components:

- A configuration tool that you can use to configure how you want the bot to respond to various types of requests.
- A set of capabilities that represent common goals or actions that customers typically want to perform (such as "Pay my bill" or "Tell me your business hours").
- A natural-language model trained to identify intents based on customer input.
- A conversation dialog flow that can handle some complex requests by prompting for additional information, generate replies, and trigger events to be handled by your application.

- A mechanism for augmenting the capabilities of the agent with custom capabilities that you define in a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} workspace and link to the agent.
- A chat widget you can embed in your web page, and an SDK you can use to develop a custom chat widget.
