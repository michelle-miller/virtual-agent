{: #getting-started}

Complete the following steps to get started by using the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} Standard Edition.
{: shortdesc}

You will be asked to choose a billing payment method and provide payment details, so have that information ready.

1.  Go to the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} page on [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/XConfigureProductView?catalogId=12301&langId=-1&storeId=18251&partNumber=DK-Watson-VA-Standard){: new_window}.
1.  Click **Continue to Checkout**.
1.  Sign in.

    Do one of the following things:

    - If you have an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} ID, specify your user name and password, and then click **Sign in**.
    - If you don't have an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} ID, click **Create an IBMid**, and then provide the required information to register.

1.  Provide the information required to complete the purchase.

    While your instance of the service is created, a {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} tile is added to the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace *Products and services* page. When the service is fully configured, the **Launch** button is enabled and you can click it to access your instance.

    An email is also sent from wvasupp@us.ibm.com with links to the service.

You can now configure the virtual agent yourself or invite more people to help you with the configuration task. For information about how to configure the agent, see [Configuring core capabilities](configure.html).

## Browser support

{{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} requires the same level of browser software as is required by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. See the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [Prerequisites ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/overview/prereqs.html#browsers){: new_window} topic for details.

## Building a team
{: #invite_users}

Give other people access to your instance of the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}}.

### About this task

Team up with others in your organization to ensure that the virtual agent is configured to meet the needs of your users. You can invite users of all types, from the experienced developer who can help you to hook up conversation transactions to your organization's backend systems, to the intern who can help you write friendly text responses for capabilities. And don't forget about the data analysts who will want to see the metrics that are collected from the conversations that users have with the virtual agent.

### Procedure

1.  Log in to the *My {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} - Products and services* page with your {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} ID: [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/ ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/){: new_window}. You must use the user ID that created the instance that you want to share or the user ID of someone who was invited to access the instance as an administrator.
1.  Click **More actions** on the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} tile to view administrative options for the service.
1.  Click **Manage authorizations**. Scroll down to the **Add new user** section, and provide the name and email address or {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} ID of the person you want to invite. If you want the user to be authorized to invite more users, then select the **Make administrator** check box.
1.  Click **Add User**.
1.  Repeat this step for each user that you want to invite.

### Results

The people that you add get an email that invites them to access the configuration tool for your virtual agent instance. They can make configuration changes and apply them. You must refresh your web page before you can see their changes.

## Welcome experience

The first person to log in to a newly provisioned instance of the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} configuration tool is presented with a series of welcome screens that walk the user through some initial setup tasks, including naming the agent. Any team members who log in to the tool subsequently do not have the same welcome experience.

If you want to change the agent name choice that was made during that initial walk-through, you can do so from the **Settings** page of the current agent.
