Understand the development steps to take to fully implement the agent.
{: shortdesc}

**Required**:

- Embed the virtual agent in an application or other channel

  You can add the IBM-provided chat interface to your customer-facing website, extend the provided chat interface, or build your own chat interface. You can also make the agent available from within an existing support channel. See [Integrating the agent](/docs/services/virtual-agent/integrate.html) for more details.

- Create application logic that supports information requests or business transactions that can occur during user conversations

  Work with the administrators who configured the capabilities that your organization will support. They can help you understand the expected behavior of the virtual agent per capability. See [Implementing core capabilities](/docs/services/virtual-agent/impl_intents.html) for more details.

**Optional**:

- Provide a custom dialog for a core capability or augment the core capabilities with capabilities of your own. See [Personalizing the agent](/docs/services/virtual-agent/personalize.html) for more details.
