You will be asked to choose a billing payment method and provide payment details, so have that information ready.

You can convert an existing trial instance of the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} to a Standard plan instance. Decide whether you want to do so before you perform this procedure. If your team spent time configuring the agent to work for your business, then you might want to convert the trial instance instead of starting over. Converting the trial instance does not preclude you from continuing to make configuration changes; you can continue to tailor the service to fit your needs. It just ensures that you can build on any work you already did without having to start over.

The Standard subscription is available for a monthly or annual fee. The Premium subscription is available for an annual fee. With both plans, you can pay for what you expect to use by choosing the number of API calls that you want the fee to cover. One API call represents one complete exchange in which a user provides input and the virtual agent responds to it.

1.  From the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}} page on [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/cognitive-customer-engagement/){: new_window}, click **Compare features and pricing**.

    > **Note:** If you want to convert a trial instance to a Standard subscription instance, then you must log in with the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} ID of someone who is an administrator of the trial instance. You cannot convert an existing trial instance to a Premium plan instance.

1.  On the *Standard Edition* tile, click **Purchase now**.

    **Note**: If you want to purchase the Premium plan, you must contact an IBM representative for assistance.

1.  Customize your subscription, and then click **Continue to Checkout**.
1.  If you have a trial subscription and are upgrading to a Standard plan, then you can retain any configuration work that was done in the trial instance by selecting **Convert trial**. Otherwise, click **Buy new subscription** to start fresh with a new instance.
1.  Provide account, billing, and payment method information, and then submit your order.

You will receive an email notification when the new service is ready. If you converted a trial instance of {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.virtualagentshort}}, then anyone with access to the trial instance is given access to the paid subscription instance automatically, and will be notified when the service is ready for use. Consider reminding the team that any calls made from now on, including those made for testing purposes, will be counted toward the API call total that you are paying for as part of the subscription fee.
